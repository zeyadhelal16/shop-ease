This E-Commerce project is a front-end web application designed for selling mobile phones and headphones. The platform provides a clean and modern interface, including a Dark Mode feature to enhance user experience and accessibility.

Users can browse products and add items to their cart using an interactive “Add to Cart” system. Selected products are dynamically displayed inside the cart, allowing users to review their choices in a smooth and responsive environment.

The project is currently built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on user interface design, interactivity, and client-side functionality. It is actively under development, with plans to integrate a back-end system and database to support real-time data storage, authentication, and full purchase processing.

This project highlights strong front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, dynamic cart management, responsive design, and theme implementation, while also serving as a foundation for future full-stack expansion.
